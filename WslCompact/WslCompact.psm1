 Usage: wslcompact [OPTIONS] [DISTROS]

 wslcompact compacts the images of WSL distros by removing unused space.
 If no option is provided, it will default to info mode, without modifying any image.
 If no distro is provided, it will process all the installed images.
 NOTE: WSL will be shut down for compacting the images.

 Options:
  no opt. Provides distro name, path, size, and estimated new size information.
     -c   Compacting mode: process the selected distros compacting the images.
     -y   replaces selected images without asking for confirmation.
     -d   Enable the processing of data images. Default is disabled.
     -h   Prints this help

 Examples:
     wslcompact
     wslcompact -c -d
     wslcompact -c -y Ubuntu Kali
